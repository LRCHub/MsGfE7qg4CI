I like digging holes
And hiding things inside them
When I'll grow old
I hope I won't forget to find
them
'Cause I've got memories
And travel like gypsies in the
night.
I built a home
And wait for someone to tear it
down
Then pack it up in boxes,
Head for the next town running
'Cause I've got memories
And travel like gypsies in the
night.
And a thousand times
I've seen this road.
A thousand times.
I've got no roots,
But my home was never on the
ground,
I've got no roots,
But my home was never on the
ground,
I've got no roots uuuh uuuh uh
uh,
I've got no roots uuuh uuuh uh
uh,
I've got no roots... [...]
I like standing still,
Boy that's just a wishful plan
Ask me where I come from,
I'll say a different land
But I've got memories
And travel like gypsies in the
night
I can't get the numbers,
And play the guessing name
It's just the place that
changes,
The rest is still the same
But I've got memories
And travel like gypsies in the
night
And a thousand times
I've seen this road,
A thousand times
I like digging holes, hiding
things inside them
When I'll grow old I won't
forget to find them
I like digging holes, hiding
things inside them
When I'll grow old I won't
forget to find them
I've got no roots! No roots!
I've got no roots... [...]
