```lrc
[00:12.66] I like digging holes and hiding things inside them
[00:16.97] When I grow old, I hope I won't forget to find them
[00:20.97] 'Cause I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night
[00:51.47] 
[00:29.33] I build a home and wait for someone to tear it down
[00:33.40] Then pack it up in boxes, head for the next town running
[00:37.43] 'Cause I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night
[01:07.93] 
[00:44.90] And a thousand times I've seen this road
[00:49.42] A thousand times
[00:57.42] 
[00:52.93] I've got no roots, but my home was never on the ground
[00:57.24] I've got no roots, but my home was never on the ground
[01:01.24] I've got no roo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oots
[01:04.91] I've got no roo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oots
[01:09.47] I've got no roots, but my home was never on the ground
[01:13.88] I've got no roots, but my home was never on the ground
[01:17.96] I've got no roo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oots
[01:21.59] I've got no roo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oots
[01:37.59] 
[01:27.27] I like standing still, boy, that's just a wishful plan
[01:31.35] Ask me where I come from, I'll say a different land
[01:35.38] But I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night
[02:04.38] 
[01:43.54] I count gates and numbers, then play the guessing game
[01:47.82] It's just the place that changes, the rest is still the same
[01:51.82] But I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night
[02:20.82] 
[01:59.38] And a thousand times I've seen this road
[02:03.97] A thousand times
[02:11.97] 
[02:07.64] I've got no roots, but my home was never on the ground
[02:11.66] I've got no roots, but my home was never on the ground
[02:15.65] I've got no roo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oots
[02:19.44] I've got no roo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oots
[02:24.10] I've got no roots, but my home was never on the ground
[02:28.16] I've got no roots, but my home was never on the ground
[02:32.41] I've got no roo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oots
[02:35.77] I've got no roo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oots
[02:51.77] 
[02:41.63] I like digging holes
[02:43.78] Hiding things inside them
[02:45.71] When I grow old
[02:47.74] I won't forget to find them
[02:49.92] I like digging holes
[02:51.91] Hiding things inside them
[02:54.06] When I grow old
[02:56.16] I won't forget to find them
[03:09.66] 
[02:58.75] I've got no roots
[03:07.25] 
[03:07.61] No roots
[03:11.61] 
[03:15.97] I've got no roots, but my home was never on the ground
[03:20.02] I've got no roots, but my home was never on the ground
[03:24.09] I've got no roo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oots
[03:27.73] I've got no roo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oots
[03:32.22] I've got no roots, but my home was never on the ground
[03:36.57] I've got no roots, but my home was never on the ground
[03:40.79] I've got no roo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oots
[03:44.00] I've got no roo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oots
[03:49.01] No!
